				<h2>S3 droplet file sharing</span></h2>
				<p>Google Chat does not allow for file sharing. Files can be shared easily via email but there is a file size limit.</p> 
				<p>One solution is to use S3 and Transmit droplets. This creates an icon (droplet) onto which files can be dropped and uploaded to the S3 folder to which the droplet points. Clicking the icon opens up that S3 folder. All employees have read/write access to the public folder.</p>
				<p>Here's how to set it up:</p>
				<ol><li>Open Transmit.</li><li>Log in to Metrum Research Group S3.</li><li>Open the <b>metrumrg-sandbox</b> bucket. A list of sandbox folders appears.</li><li>Right-click on the <b>public</b> folder. A context menu drops down.</li><li>Choose <b>Save Droplet For Folder... </b>The Save Droplet dialogue box opens.<br/><a imageanchor='1' href='/assets/img/droplet.png'><img src='/assets/img/droplet.png' border='0'/></a></li><li>Save the droplet to Applications.</li><li>Choose the <b>Save password in droplet</b> radio button.</li><li>In Finder, go into Applications and drag the droplet to your dock.</li></ol>
				<p>Now, any file you drag to the droplet in your dock will be uploaded to the metrumrg-sandbox/public folder in S3. Clicking on the droplet will open up Transmit and bring you to the metrumrg-sandbox/public folder where you can then download shared files. Try to delete files in the public folder that are no longer needed.</p>
